# woia-scheduling

## Operating flow

DISCOVER -> DECIDE -> IMPLEMENT -> VALIDATE -> REPORT

## Discover

Resolve current organization, source authority, actor, task grant and exact operation scope before accessing data. Load [contract](references/CONTRACT.md) for all mutations, unknown effects, takeover or policy decisions. Portable implementation: [provider](scripts/provider.mjs).

## Decide

Choose only a declared action. Missing trusted authority, stale policy, source conflicts or unsupported bindings block the affected operation. Technical availability never grants permission.

## Implement

Use the deterministic provider with host-authenticated context and a qualified atomic persistence port. Preserve operation identity, evidence and source links; never put durable truth in chat. Read [persistence and authority port](references/PORTS.md) before binding a host.

## Validate

Run local synthetic tests and centralized thin certification on a clean exact candidate. Qualification of actual organization binding, accounts and external providers remains NOT_RUN until independently exercised.

## Report

Bind results to exact action, operation, source, organization and candidate identity. Report unknown/blocked outcomes honestly; no live delivery, professional validity or Production Ready claim follows from unit tests.
